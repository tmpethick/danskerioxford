This is a website by Jakob Pethick seeking to help Danish students apply for Oxford (or Cambridge). As of now it's a difficult and unnecessarily confusing process to find relevant information. This websites tries to gather some of the learnings he made and some of the information he already collectedâ€“so it doesn't have to be done again.

*This is one of my old projects move to Github in my attempt to host some of my simpel static stuff from here.*


## Development

To run the server locally you need the gems:
```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Now you can run it with:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve -w
```

.. and it will automatically track file changes (except for `_config.yml`).

###Css

If you're going to change the styles install stylus and nib:
```
npm install -g stylus
npm install nib
```

To compile the stylus files into css run:
```
make
```
